I am a Junior at NYU majoring in Computer Science and minor in math and business studies. 

### More Information

I currently live in Jersey City but I call Guangzhou (a southern city in China) my home. In my free time, I love taking picture with film camera. Compare to digital cam, I found film camera to be a unique and subtle way to capture the most precious moments in my daily life. Feel free to check out some of my work at my instagram.
