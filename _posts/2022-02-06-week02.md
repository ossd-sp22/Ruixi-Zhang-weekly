## Code of Conduct Class Activity

In the first glance, the two documents look very similar, both of them contain information like scope and standards. However, if we take a closer look, there are some differences. The major noticeable difference is that the code of conduct for the Go project is longer and therefore more specific compared to the Contributor Covenants’. Go project’s conduct of conduct contains more specific information and guidelines regarding conflict resolution and it also specifies the main values of its company. I think the reason may be that the Contributor Covenants’ Code of Conduct is a framework that [many other projects](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/) adopted, while the Go’s project was adapted from the Contributor Covenant, so it reasonably elaborated on it. I believe that perfectly explains their differences.

 [Eclipsed](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) was also a project that has its code of conduct adapted from the Contributor Covenant. Unlike the code of conduct of the Go project, Eclipsed’s code of conduct was almost the same as the original Contributor Covenant. They only added an “Enforcement” section. The difference between Eclipsed and Go’s code of conduct shows that different open source projects can adapt to the same code of conduct and customize and elaborate to different extents.

The code of conduct for the Sugar Lab project was adapter from the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct). The Ubuntu Code of Conduct contains a lot more information compare to Contributor Covenant. It contains a major section called “**Leadership, authority and responsibility”.** The code of conduct specifies that there should be a “Community Council” that judges an individual’s decision. It regards itself as a “meritocracy.” In contrast, the Contributor Covenant offers an environment with more freedom and less hierarchy.

I also dive into the code of conduct of [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). When I first look at it, I was shocked by how specific it contains to the previous code of conduct. Also, at the very top, it specifies the dates of its most recent update., which is one year ago. This shows that the code of conduct for Mozilla was constantly changing and updating. It not only specifies the normal dos and don’ts, but the Mozilla code of conduct also provides overviews on when and how to use this guideline. In the section on License and Attribution, learned that the Mozilla code of conduct was adapted from seven other codes of conduct which include [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct), [Rust Language Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html), [LGBTQ in Technology Code of Conduct](http://lgbtq.technology/coc.html), etc. This example shows that an open-source project can adapt from multiple codes of conduct.

## Firefox Browser Add Ons Activity

At first, the idea of building a Firefox add-on in one week sounds very intimidating. However, After completing the activity, I felt a lot more relaxed. The activity provides a very good guide. Aside from the content of the project, the group project also made me nervous. I haven’t done a group project in so long. For the less than five group projects I have done in the past two years, I always choose to stay in my comfort zone and team up with people I already know. Getting random teammates was kind of a challenge to me. Thankfully last Thursday’s group session went well and two of my teammates are very nice. I am actually very looking forward to how this activity will go.
