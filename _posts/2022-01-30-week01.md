## Open Source:

When I thought of open source, what immediately cames to my mind is GitHub. When I first heard of this platform, I was totally stunned by how people share their project and even raw code to the entire internet. Unlike acedemic papers where I need miscellaneous processes to gain access, on Github, all I need is a simple sign up process. I later learnt that a lot of well-known tech projects like firefox and even Java are open source as well. A question soon came to me, “In the world of computer science, why people are comfortable of sharing their work, which they possibly spent a great amount of efforts in, to the entire internet?” I then realized that it is way more than a pure intention of selflessness, the open source enviroment actually played an important role in pushing the entire tech industry forward. 

## Open Source and Me:

While being amazed by the idea of open source, I was deeply overwhelmed. I felt that I have learnt a lot in my computer science classes but never know how to use and broaden my knowledge to the real world. I felt disconnected. People always say, “just go to Github, start a project on your own, or find a project to contribute to.” It sound fairly easy, but whenever I was in Github, I just lost all my direction. I hope that by the end of this class, I can become a confident contributer and be more involved in the world of open source. 

## Open Source Projects:

- **[Wikipedia](https://www.eleuther.ai/projects/gpt-neo/):** I was constantly warned by people, “do not use Wikipedia, the information up there are not accurate since everyone can contribute to it.” Despite these warnings, I found myself always clicking on Wikipedia links when I am trying to get a quick understandings about something.
- **VS Code:** VS Code was definately my go to IDE. I like it for how costumizable and adaptable it is. It contains a lot of entensions that I can add to the IDE to fit my programming needs. I wonder that it is its open sourced charactersitic that allows it to be such costumizable.
- **Java:** Java is the programming language that I am most comfortable in, partly because that both Intro to CS and Data Structure are taught in Java. However, I did not previously know that it is open source.
- **GPT-Neo**: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a language model auto generate contents based on the learning from existing texts. The more more well-known version is GPT-3 developed by OpenAI. Unfortuately, GPT-3 is not open source and it is a paid service. In this context, GPT-Neo is a open sourced version of GPT-3 developed by ELeutherAI.
